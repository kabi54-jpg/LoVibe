This project is a modern, customizable productivity dashboard built with React and Tailwind CSS. It features draggable and resizable widgets which including a Pomodoro timer, to-do list, and YouTube playlist player. All Widgets can be toggled from a sleek sidebar and styled with multiple transparent or blurred themes. Widget positions, sizes, and user data are saved automatically using localStorage, creating a smooth and personalized workspace experience similar to floating desktop widgets.
